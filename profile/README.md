# Atomic Learning

The Atomic Learning Platform is a asynchronous learning tool currently being developed by the [Early Career Researcher Institute](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/early-career-researcher-institute/) at Imperial College London. It aims to collect a large amount of asynchronous learning content together, split into a large number of pages. Each page is designed to teach one thing (hence the word "atomic"). Each page notes which other pages are its prerequisites. 

A learner may select a page to be one of their Goals and order their Goals. By noting which pages are prerequisites of these Goals, the platform maintains a Queue of pages for the learner to complete that the learner can progress through. When doing so, a learner marks each page as "complete", meaning they will not need to repeat it if it is a prerequisite of another Goal.

Users may creating Learning Paths. These are essentially collections of Goals that can be shared with others, allowing another user to add to their own collection of Goals. This allows educators to quickly create programmes of asynchronous learning and share them with their learners.

All pages within the platform are shared in one large pool. This allows educators to build upon the pages created by others with the aim of reducing duplication across the university. Improvements to and iterations upon existing pages produced by others is encouraged in the service of creating an overall learning resource that is as good as can be.
